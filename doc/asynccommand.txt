*asynccommand.txt*	Plug-in for running asynchronous shell commands.

==============================================================================

                                                                *asynccommand*
Introduction~

AsyncCommand allows you to execute shell commands without waiting for them 
to complete. When the application terminates, its output can be loaded into 
a vim buffer.

You can define your own commands by following the same format:
Define a launch function that passes the external command and result handler
(like asynchandler#quickfix) to asynccommand#run. You can use the handlers in
autoload/asynchandler.vim or define your own.

						   *asynccommand-requirements*
AsyncCommand Requirements~

AsyncCommand needs vim compiled with |+clientserver|. Check your vim version
with |:version|.

						       *asynccommand-commands*
Commands~

:AsyncCommand {cmd}					       *:AsyncCommand*
		Execute shell {cmd} in the background.

:AsyncShell {cmd}					         *:AsyncShell*
                Execute shell {cmd} in the background. When it completes, open
                the result in a split window.

						      *asynccommand-functions*
Functions~

asynccommand#run({command} [, {function}[, {dict}]])        *asynccommand#run*
		Execute a shell {command} in the background.
		After the command is executed {function} can will be called.
		{function} can be either:
		|Funcref|
			A Function ref
		|Dictionary|
			A dictionary with a |Dictionary-function| named key
			named 'get'.

		The {dict} argument can be supplied to be used to call with
		the {function}. This the same as using the third argument to
		|call()|.

		The {function} will be of the following form:
		some_function(temp_name)

		temp_name will be the name of temporary file used to capture
		the output of the {command}.

		Examples: >

		command! GenerateCscopeFiles call GenerateCscopeFiles()
		function! GenerateCscopeFiles()
		    let cmd = 'find . -name "*.java"'
		    let env = asynchandler#rename('cscope.files')
		    call asynccommand#run(cmd, env)
		endfunction

		command! -nargs=+ Ack call AckFunc(<q-args>)
		function! AckFunc(query)
		    let cmd = 'ack -H --nocolor --nogroup --column '
		    let cmd .= a:query
		    let efm = "%f:%l:%c:%m"
		    let title = "[Found: %s] Ack"
		    let env = asynchandler#quickfix(efm, title)
		    call asynccommand#run(cmd, env)
		endfunction

		command! -nargs=1 AntBuild call AntBuildFunc(<q-args>)
		function! AntBuildFunc(target)
		    let cmd = 'ant '
		    let cmd .= a:target
		    let env = {}
		    function env.get(temp_file) dict
		        let h = ''
		        if self.return_code == 0
		            " use tiny split window height on success
		            let h = 1
		        endif
		        " open the file in a split
		        exec h . "split " . a:temp_file
		        " remove boring build output
		        %s/^\[xslt\].*$/
		        " go back to the previous window
		        wincmd p
		    endfunction

		    " tab_restore prevents interruption when the task completes.
		    " All provided asynchandlers already use tab_restore.
		    call asynccommand#run(cmd, asynccommand#tab_restore(env))
		endfunction

                             *asynccommand-callbacks* *asynccommand-handlers*
Common Callbacks~

asynchandler#rename({path})                             *asynchandler#rename*
		Rename the temp_file to {path} after the background command
		has been executed.

asynchandler#quickfix({errorformat}, {title})         *asynchandler#quickfix*
		Open the results in |quickfix-window| using {errorformat} as
		the 'errorformat'. A {title} can be provided to give the
		quickfix-window, similar to |w:quickfix_title|. Put %s into
		the {title} to have it replaced with the number of results.

asynchandler#quickfix_add({errorformat}, {title}) *asynchandler#quickfix_add*
		Same as |asynchandler#quickfix| but results will be added.

asynchandler#loclist({errorformat}, {title})           *asynchandler#loclist*
		Same as |asynchandler#quickfix| but use the |location-list|.

asynchandler#loclist_add({errorformat}, {title})   *asynchandler#loclist_add*
		Same as |asynchandler#quickfix_add| but use the
		|location-list|.

asynchandler#split()                                     *asynchandler#split*
		Open the results of the asynchronous shell command in a new
		split.

						  *asynccommand-configuration*
Configuration~

g:asynccommand_prg                                        *g:asynccommand_prg*
		Override the default path to vim to be used by AsyncCommand to
		capture data from backgrounded commands.  AsyncCommand is
		compatible with |macvim| and will use mvim if it is available.
		See |mvim| for setup.

shellredir                                           *asynccommand-shellredir*
		You may find it useful to change vim's |shellredir| setting to
		use tee (which writes to a file, but also to stdout). On
		MS-Windows, this will allow you to see the output of the
		command in the opened command window.
>
		" redirect to both standard output and files
		set shellredir=2>&1\|tee\ %s
